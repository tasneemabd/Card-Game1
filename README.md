## Introduction
The Four Players Cards Game is a strategic card game designed for four players. The game involves playing cards with the goal of minimizing the number of rounds won, as the player with the fewest 'eats' at the end of the game wins.

## Game Setup
- A standard 52-card deck is used.
- The deck is shuffled, and each player is dealt 13 cards.

## Gameplay Rules
1. Each player plays one card per round.
2. Players must play a card that is smaller than the cards currently on the table.
3. If a player cannot play a smaller card, they must play their smallest card.
4. Once four cards are on the table, the player with the highest card 'eats' the cards and collects them.
5. This process repeats for 13 rounds until all cards are played.

## Winning Conditions
- After all 13 rounds, the game ends.
- The player with the fewest 'eats' (the smallest number of collected cards) wins the game.
